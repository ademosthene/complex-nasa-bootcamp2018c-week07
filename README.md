## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, NASA and OpenWeather APIs.

This project was written in JavaScript using the fetch method to access the NASA API. This fetch returns a list of the NASA facilities which is then passed through the Weather API. The Weather uses the location data to return the temperature. This project was designed using CSS3.

## Lessons Learned:

This project furthered my understanding of complex API structures.
